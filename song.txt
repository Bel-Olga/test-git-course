[Verse 1]
Doctor, look into my eyes
I've been breathing air, but there's no sign of life
Doctor, the problem's in my chest
My heart feels cold as ice, but it's anybody's guess

[Pre-Chorus]
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind

[Chorus]
Well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Darker in the day than the dead of night
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right

[Verse 2]
Sweet nurse, don't look at me that way
I've seen those eyes before, I can tell you want to play
Counselor, give me some advice
Tell me, how hard will I fall if I live a double life?
