[Verse 1]
Doctor, look into my eyes
I've been breathing air, but there's no sign of life
Doctor, the problem's in my chest
My heart feels cold as ice, but it's anybody's guess

[Pre-Chorus]
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor, can you help me? 'Cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
